      question: How do I use my Miami address?
      answer: >-
        At checkout, list your FREE U.S. ADDRESS as the address for the order to
        be shipped to. To prevent delays in receiving your package(s), please
        ensure that you input the correct name and address.


        Your Miami address is a physical address where Aeropost receives and
        processes your packages and then sends them to your selected store or
        smart parcel locker in your destination country.


        No customer address is exactly the same; each address is made up of your
        account number, your country code (3 letters), our physical address, and
        the postal code.


        (Example below)


        Miami Address for PACKAGES (Billing and Shipping   Address)


        Name: [[ CUSTOMER NAME ]] [[ GTW ]]-[[ ACCOUNT# ]]

        Address Line 1: 1 Aeropost Way

        Address Line 2: 
                  City: Miami
                 State: FL
              Zip Code: 33206-3206
        
        Phone Number: (786) 322-2032


        Note: Please only include your  First and Last Name, no Middle or Second Last Name.
    1:
      question: How to calculate the price?
      answer: >-
        Before placing an order with your FREE U.S. ADDRESS, you can view an
        estimate of how much you will have to pay for the shipment and
        nationalization of the package.


        To do so, simply enter the following details into the Aeropost Cost
        Calculator: product category, product weight, listed price, and your
        account type.


        In order to generate the most accurate estimated cost, be sure to list
        the correct product category by either typing the name of the item you
        want to quote or the name most similar to the item. (for example, for a
        stopwatch you can enter "clock").
    2:
      question: How to pre-alert?
      answer: >-
        After making a purchase, you should submit an Aeropost pre-alert to let
        us know in advance that a package is on its way to our Miami fulfillment
        center.  This step is crucial in ensuring that package processing is
        faster and smoother.


        To submit a pre-alert for an incoming package, go to 'My Account' and
        select + PRE-ALERT YOUR PACKAGE. Fill-in the pre-alert form with the
        package details and upload the invoice.
    3:
      question: How to return a product?
      answer: >-
          To return a package you must contact the supplier or manufacturer of the
          product and obtain a return authorization (neither Aeropost nor its
          affiliates can contact the supplier or manufacturer to request such
          authorization).  Once it has been issued, you must contact Aeropost and
          an agent will give you the instructions to follow. Aeropost must receive
          all the corresponding documentation as well as the merchandise to be
          returned no later than 15 business days prior to the expiration date of
          the return authorization issued by the supplier.
      disclaimer: We do not provide cash refunds; instead, refunds are issued through in-store credit or wire transfers only.
    4:
      question: How to set up autopay?
      answer: >-
        After you enter your card information, click the Auto-Pay option.


        Your card data will then be securely encrypted and linked to your
        account for future billings.


        OR


        Go to My Account » Profile » Payment Methods, and select AutoPay to save
        your card information in advance for future purchases.
